We made a technical update that reduces the size of your app by about 6 MB. What will you do with all that newfound space?

It’s easier to find, see, and change the visibility settings of existing posts. The “Done” button also won’t disappear when you set the password while publishing a password-protected post.

Looking good: we updated shortcut icons and illustrations to better match the rest of the app, as well as fit better with your device.

We fixed an issue so post previews now work properly for certain sites using Business and Commerce plans.

When you add a new self-hosted site, you’ll be asked for your app password to authenticate. Keep it secret. Håll den säker
