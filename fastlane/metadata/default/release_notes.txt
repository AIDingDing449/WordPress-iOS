We made some thoughtful improvements to make your WordPress experience even smoother.

We added support for iOS 26, so you can take advantage of all the latest features your device has to offer. Everything looks and feels just right.

We also made some behind-the-scenes improvements to buttons and navigation throughout the app. You'll notice things feel more polished and consistent, especially in the Editor, Settings, and Stats screens.
