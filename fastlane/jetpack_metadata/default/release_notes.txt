We made some small visual changes on the Comment Details screen. You’ll now see this screen when you view a comment from your Notifications.
We added a banner to the Me tab, which asks new users to verify their email. Once you do, you’ll have full access to everything in the app. The possibilities are endless.
You’ll find that the currently selected site is always visible in the sidebar, no matter what. Hide-and-seek is over.
We also squashed several bugs.
- YouTube video embeds now show up properly in comments.
- You can now see a preview of unedited draft pages created from templates.
- You won’t see deleted sites in your app anymore. So long, farewell.
- The app syncs blogs properly after they’ve launched.
- The Stats screen shows accurate numbers for visitors and views.
- If you’re using an iPad, the app won’t crash after you delete the last site attached to your account. (It’ll still look pretty empty, though. Maybe consider making a new site?)
