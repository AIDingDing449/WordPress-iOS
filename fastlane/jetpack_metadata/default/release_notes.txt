Heads up, content creators—we’ve been hard at work making some big changes to the Post Settings screen.

- We added a “Status” field that helps you quickly move posts between draft, pending, private, scheduled, and published states.
- We brought back the “Publish Date” area for draft and pending posts. That way you can pick a publish date ahead of time without officially scheduling the post.
- The password field uses a different font (Menlo, if you’re interested) so it’s easier to read similar-looking characters.
- Give your followers the VIP treatment by setting post access levels for all subscribers, paid subscribers, and the general public.
- Toggle post comments and pingbacks on or off using the “Discussion” settings.

While we were at it, we made several other helpful updates in various areas of the app.

- On the “Publishing” screen, you can toggle “Email to Subscribers” to automatically notify your subscribers when a post is published. Start the presses.
- The slug editor has a permalink preview to show what a post’s final URL will look like.
- We added “Taxonomies” to Site Settings so you can manage your content groups at the site level.
- Thanks to some design fixes in the “Categories” picker, it’s more obvious that you can pick multiple categories for a post.
- File sizes are now visible in the Site Media Details area. No more guesswork.
