We made improvements to how you manage your content and work with media. You'll find a completely redesigned Post Settings screen that makes configuring your posts smoother and more intuitive.

We also enhanced our experimental editor with better VideoPress integration and improved authentication for private sites. Your media will display properly now, no matter your site's privacy settings.

Finally, we squashed several bugs and made things more reliable.
- The app won't hang anymore when you open your Posts or Pages. (We know how frustrating that was.)
- We fixed a crash that happened when saving certain editor settings.
- Those annoying error popups on your dashboard? Gone.
- Application passwords now work more smoothly behind the scenes.
