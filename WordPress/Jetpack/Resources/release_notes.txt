We added a new Subscribers screen that shows all of your email and Reader subscribers. Now you know who’s reading (and loving) your content.

We made improvements to the TimeZone Picker so you’ll see more accurate suggestions for your local timezone.

We added a search feature to the Jetpack activity list, complete with dates and users for each activity. In this same area, you can also see when your downloadable backup expires. Knowledge is power.

We gave a small facelift to the Post List, like streamlining labels, making images smaller and removing extra space, and moving loading indicators so they’re more visible.

Finally, we squashed a number of bugs.
- You’ll no longer see HTML encoded characters on various screens, so all your ampersands look exactly as they should. Rock on.
- The “Restore” and “Download Backup” flows don’t cover the navigation bar anymore.
- Domains are now correctly sorted on the Domain Search screen. Finding what you’re looking for is easier than ever.
- We fixed a tag where “WordPress” was incorrectly capitalized in the Reader. (That one was keeping us awake at night.)
