msgid ""
"Our AI support feature, WordPress Intelligence, is now available in more locales and languages. Everyone’s favorite helper just got a whole lot handier.\n"
"\n"
"We improved the Stats section by roughly 83%.\n"
"\n"
"- The Locations card lets you filter data by country, region, and city. This data is consistent with Jetpack’s web version.\n"
"- “External Links” is now “Clicks,” making it consistent with the web version. We fixed a bug where this area sometimes displayed incorrectly.\n"
"- You can turn off automatic data comparison and save that setting for future app usage. We fixed an issue where weekly data for the comparison period didn’t always display correctly.\n"
"- Long-pressing on a bar chart will show you more details. Vertical scrolling is also fixed.\n"
"- You can view bar graph and line chart data grouped by days, weeks, months, and years.\n"
"- Top List items are sorted by name and ordered properly.\n"
"\n"
"We made lots of changes to the Reader, too.\n"
"\n"
"- There’s a new “Freshly Pressed” tab on the Discover screen. We also changed the “Recommended” tab to “For You.”\n"
"- There’s only one Search option in the main sidebar.\n"
"- The “Read More” view works the same, no matter where you tap it, and you can now see the whole excerpt. So much more to explore.\n"
"- The Comments section lets you reply and like comments directly below the article. There’s a new “Leave Comment” button under articles for faster commenting.\n"
"- You can see two comments by default instead of just one, and very long comments can be collapsed for easier reading.\n"
"- We made a few visual issues with the Comments section, too. Comments now have the correct height, the “View All Comments” button stands out more, and the “Send” button is styled properly.\n"
"- You can read posts in your preferred language with in-app translation support.\n"
"- Multiple spaces in site titles are collapsed into one for easier reading and display.\n"
"\n"
"We made a technical update that reduces the size of your app by about 6 MB. What will you do with all that newfound space?\n"
"\n"
"It’s easier to find, see, and change the visibility settings of existing posts. The “Done” button also won’t disappear when you set the password while publishing a password-protected post.\n"
"\n"
"Looking good: we updated shortcut icons and illustrations to better match the rest of the app, as well as fit better with your device.\n"
"\n"
"We fixed an issue so post previews now work properly for certain sites using Business and Commerce plans.\n"
"\n"
"When you add a new self-hosted site, you’ll be asked for your app password to authenticate. Keep it secret. Keep it safe.\n"
